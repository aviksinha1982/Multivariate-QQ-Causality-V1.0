This code is a part of the manuscript "Modeling Renewable Energy Market Performance under Climate Policy Uncertainty: A Novel Multivariate Quantile Causality Analysis".

This code is developed in Excel VBA Macro with Matlab integration. The data should be kept in a .csv format with the required variables only. Keeping extra variables will hinder the Macro from running. 

The code will produce both Unconditional and Conditional causality test outcomes. So, the dependent variable (Y), independent variables (X), and the control variable (CONTROL) are to be put in a .csv file for uploading.

The first version of the code needs a lag length of 1.

The transformations to be used: REN, GB, INN, NEE, FSLR, TPIC, CWEN, TSLA: No Transformation || INF, VIX, CPU: Log Transformation
